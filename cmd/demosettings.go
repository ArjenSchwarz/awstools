Fog provides the option to create a settings file in different formats: YAML, JSON, or TOML and you can always override its values with a flag when you run your command.
You can do this by creating a file called fog.yaml (or .json/.toml) in either the project directory from which you run the command, or in your home directory.
The project directory will take precedence if both are present. In addition, using the --config flag you can provide a custom path for your settings file.

So, what are your current settings and what would they look like in a settings file?

1. Read the requirements and design files in plans/$ARGUMENTS.
2. Create a comprehensive list of tasks based on this plan. These tasks should be organised into phases and have subtasks. Each task, both main and subtask, should have a checkbox.
3. Ensure the list of tasks covers all requirements and is optimised for agentic use and shows where work can be done in parallel. Assume that all tasks will be done by agents, but make a note of it if any task is likely to require human intervention or special tooling.
4. Write this list of tasks to tasks.md in plans/$ARGUMENTS

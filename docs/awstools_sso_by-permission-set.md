## awstools sso by-permission-set

A basic overview of the SSO Config Permission Sets grouped by permission set

### Synopsis

Provides an overview of all the permission sets and assignments attached to an account,
	grouped by permission set.

You can filter the output to a single permission set by supplying the --resource-id (-r) flag with the permission set name or arn.

Verbose mode will add the policies for the permissionsets in the textual output formats drawio output will generate a graph that goes SSO Instance -> Permission Sets -> Accounts -> User/Group. You may notice the same accounts shown multiple times, this is to improve readability not a bug. dot output is currently limited as it shows internal names only

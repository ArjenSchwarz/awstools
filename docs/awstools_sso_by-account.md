## awstools sso by-account

A basic overview of the SSO Config Permission Sets by account

### Synopsis

Provides an overview of all the permission sets and assignments attached to an account,
	grouped by account.

You can filter the output to a single account by supplying the --resource-id (-r) flag with the account ID or, if you use a name file, the account alias from the name file.

Verbose mode will add the policies for the permissionsets in the textual output formats drawio output will generate a graph that goes SSO Instance -> Accounts -> Permission Sets -> User/Group You may notice the same permission sets shown multiple times, this is to improve readability not a bug. dot output is currently limited as it shows internal names only

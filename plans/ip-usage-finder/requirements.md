# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ip-usage-finder feature will provide a command-line tool that enables users to search for IP addresses within their AWS infrastructure and identify which Elastic Network Interface (ENI) the IP belongs to, along with the associated AWS resources and services. This tool will support both primary and secondary IP addresses and provide detailed information about the connected resources including EC2 instances, VPC endpoints, load balancers, and other AWS services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to search for an IP address and identify which ENI it belongs to, so that I can quickly troubleshoot network connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user provides an IP address as input THEN the system SHALL search all ENIs in the specified AWS account and region
2. IF the IP address is found on an ENI THEN the system SHALL return the ENI ID and associated metadata
3. WHEN the IP address is not found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate "not found" message
4. IF the IP address is a secondary IP on an ENI THEN the system SHALL identify and return the ENI information

### Requirement 2
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see detailed information about the AWS resource connected to an ENI, so that I can understand the full context of the network configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an ENI is associated with an EC2 instance THEN the system SHALL return the instance ID, name tag, and instance type
2. IF the EC2 instance is part of an Auto Scaling Group THEN the system SHALL return the ASG name and details
3. WHEN an ENI is associated with a VPC endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the endpoint ID and service name
4. IF the ENI is associated with a load balancer THEN the system SHALL return the load balancer name and type

### Requirement 3
**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want to search across multiple AWS accounts and regions, so that I can locate IP addresses in my entire infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user specifies a profile flag THEN the system SHALL search using the specified AWS profile
2. IF a user specifies a region flag THEN the system SHALL search only in the specified region
3. WHEN no region is specified THEN the system SHALL search in the default region from AWS configuration
4. IF the user has access to multiple accounts via roles THEN the system SHALL support cross-account searches

### Requirement 4
**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the output to be available in multiple formats, so that I can integrate the results with other tools and reporting systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user requests JSON output THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON data
2. IF the user requests table output THEN the system SHALL return human-readable tabular format
3. WHEN the user requests CSV output THEN the system SHALL return comma-separated values
4. IF no output format is specified THEN the system SHALL default to JSON format

### Requirement 5
**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to see comprehensive network interface details, so that I can assess security configurations and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an ENI is found THEN the system SHALL return security group IDs and names
2. IF the ENI has multiple IP addresses THEN the system SHALL list all primary and secondary IPs
3. WHEN the ENI is in a specific subnet THEN the system SHALL return subnet ID and VPC ID
4. IF the ENI has associated route tables THEN the system SHALL return routing information

### Requirement 6
**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and validation, so that I can effectively use the tool and understand any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an invalid IP address format is provided THEN the system SHALL return a clear validation error message
2. IF AWS credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error with guidance
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
4. IF the user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL return a clear permission error message
